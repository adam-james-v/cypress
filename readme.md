# Cypress

Generative art projects and experiments.

## Usage
Launch a Clojure REPL and load the project. A better usage situation will evolve over time.

You can also run the (art-grid) function via a CLI script:

```sh
clj -M cli.clj
```

Which will save the result to `output.svg`.

## Status
Open experimenting. I want to turn different generative ideas into scripts and/or interactive Client-side Webpages. For now, Cypress is just a messy collection of functions and ideas, with some fun output examples. See the examples folder for some neat SVGs I've already generated.
